Name: torsion

Description: This is an app desined for competitors in the VEX V5RC robotics competition. In this competition, teams are required to find alliance partners, and this app greatly simplifies this process by allowing teams to request and accept alliance invitations (reducing the likelihood of teams being rejected during the alliance selection period) and by allowing teams to communicate with a chat function.

How did you build this: This was my first time building a mobile app. I used react native - for the cross platform functionality, and the ease of porting to desktop with electon - along with expo to greatly simply testing on real devices. I used mostly the online documentation, as well as StackOverflow and other forums for help learning react native, and Mozilla web docs for any javascript help I needed, since I had not used JavaScript much previously.

How many hours did you spend on this: 32+ hours
