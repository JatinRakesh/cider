Name: GurmukhiTutor

Description:
This app addresses the issue of Gurmukhi illiteracy among 320,000 Punjabi Sikhs living in America. While many Punjabis speak Punjabi fluently at home due to family practices, they often struggle with writing Punjabi. To address this problem, many parents send their children to Sunday School, hoping that they will learn Gurmukhi letters and connect with their culture. However, Sunday Schoolâ€™s limited weekly time combined with additional schoolwork from regular schools stand as obstacles for children to retain and practice Gurmukhi. Learning Gurmukhi letters is crucial for writing literacy and this app will break down these barriers to help children practice their Gurmukhi letters. It will help them retain information and learn to differentiate between similar-looking letters that are crucial to understanding and writing Gurmukhi. With the portability of mobile devices, users can practice anytime and anywhere. This app is different because it specifically focuses on Gurmukhi and teaches users how to effectively and correctly write the language. This differs from other apps that primarily emphasize speaking skills. In addition, many language apps offer popular languages like Spanish, Russian or Japanese and often overlook Punjabi. This app will play a crucial role in preserving and promoting the Punjabi language in America.
